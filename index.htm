<h1>Goomapics is up</h1>
<p>This website is a long time in the making. For many years I have known how to build a website, but haven't done so until now.<br>
    With the many views I have received from my pictures I have taken through the years in google maps and becoming a google maps<br>
    guide I decided to make this site for those who admire my work. I call it goomapics because I got my inspiration and many views<br>
    from google maps.</p>
